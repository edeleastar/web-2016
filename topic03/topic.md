# The Box Model

In order to style the same html elements in different ways we need to use classes. This allows us to target specific occurences of an html element for styling purposes. At the heart of the layout engine in web browsers is a concept called the 'box model'. This defines a general layout structure for all HTML elements, providing a language for specifying important dimensions and relationships to other elements.
