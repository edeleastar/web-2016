#The Image

Make sure the 'navigation' division is located towards the top of the page structure between the header and the maincontent. (If you copied the output of last weeks lab, it will be near the end) If we were to take a view of any of the pages using the folding feature if eclipse, we would like to see this:

There are several methods for creating nice navigation on your site, the method we teach in this lab is a pure CSS method using one image for the tabs on the navigation menu. It is possible to use multiple images however:

 - Each image has a header section. The filesize of six small images would be about twice as big as the filesize of one big image.
 - Each image requires its own HTTP request. This wastes both bandwidth and server processing time. Due to the images being requested separately this also means that the page will take longer to load, especially if the user's browser downloads the files one by one.
 - There is no way to apply the method used here with more than two images for one tab, since each tab consists of only two elements (`<li`> and `<a`>) and only one background image can be applied to an element.

There are two states for each tab, selected and not selected.

Each state will take up one row of the image and will be 500 pixels wide.

This is the image here:

Save this image into your Lab05 folder. For this lab it is the only image we will use so no need to create an images folder.
You can see that the image has two parts, the first top row will be used for non selected tabs, the second lower row will be used for the selected tab. The image also has curved corners left and right. This is important and impacts how we write our CSS so that each tab has a curve left and right regardless of the size of the tab.
