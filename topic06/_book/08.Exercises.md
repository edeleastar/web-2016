##Exercise 1: Containing Segment

Here is a slightly changed version of the same site

- <a href="archives/final/home.html" target="_blank"> Improved Spacebook </a>

Can you see the difference? Can you change your lab to be exactly the same as this one? 


##Exercise 2: List

Semantic UI has its own take on how lists can be implemented:

- <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/elements/list.html" target="_blank"> Semantic UI Lists </a>

Explore some of the options here - and change the list - say on the home page - to use some of these styles.

##Exercise 3: Rework Assignment

Take your assignment 2 solution - starting with 1 or 2 pages only, and change them to use the semantic UI framework, removing your own style sheet initially (you can bring in parts of it later).

To do this, you will need to make use of the semantic menus and grid system - more or less as we have been doing here. There is considerably more variation possible of course - and it would be interesting to see what new visual features your site could take one based on this particular framework.
