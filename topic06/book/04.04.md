#max-width

For the following experiments, work in the `03.max-width` folder.

Using max-width instead of width in this situation will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on mobile. 

~~~
body {
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto; 
}
~~~

Using the same text we had previously, resize this page to check it out. The difference is quite subtle.

You can also set the max-width to a percentage  - try this:

~~~
body {
  max-width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto; 
}
~~~

Note how this varies from pixels when the page is very narrow.
