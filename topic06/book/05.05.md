#box model

For the following experiments, work in the `05.box-model` folder.

While we're talking about width, we should talk about width's big caveat: the box model. When you set the width of an element, the element can actually appear bigger than what you set: the element's border and padding will stretch out the element beyond the specified width. 

Look at the following example, where two elements with the same width value end up different sizes in the result.

Hers are the elements:

~~~
  <div class="simple">
    <p>
      I'm smaller...
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="fancy">
    <p>
      And I'm bigger!
    </p>
  </div>
~~~

Your starter css already includes:

~~~
body {
  max-width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
~~~

... to keep things tidy. Now add:

~~~
.simple {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  border: dashed 1px;
}

.fancy {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  padding: 50px;
  border: dashed 1px;
}
~~~

Browse now and observe the results. The difference in size is because the padding is added to the width.

(Note that in this a subsequent examples we are turning on a dash border to make the structural aspects of the page visible)
