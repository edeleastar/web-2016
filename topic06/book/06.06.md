#Box Sizing

For the following experiments, work in the `06.box-sizing` folder.

Over the generations, people realized that box calculations cab be error prone, so a new CSS property called box-sizing was created. 

When you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width. 

Using these elements as the last step:

~~~
  <div class="simple dashed">
    <p>
      We're the same size now!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="fancy dashed">
    <p>
      Hooray!
    </p>
  </div>
~~~

Your started css includes this already:

~~~
body {
  width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto; 
}

.dashed {
  border: dashed 1px;
}
~~~

Now add this:

.simple {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
          box-sizing: border-box;
}

.fancy {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  padding: 50px;
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
          box-sizing: border-box;
}
~~~

Since this is so much better, some authors want all elements on all their pages to always work this way. Such authors put the following CSS on their pages:

~~~
* {
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
          box-sizing: border-box;
}
~~~

This ensures that all elements are always sized in this more intuitive way.

Since box-sizing is pretty new, you should use the -webkit- and -moz- prefixes for now. This technique enables experimental features in specific browsers.

Here is a 'canonical' set of rules we will include in most of our CSS files from now on:

~~~
* {
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
          box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto; 
}

.dashed {
  border: dashed 1px;
}
~~~

These rules :

- setting the `border-box` sizing for all elements
- setting the overall page width to 80% of the page
- establishing a `dashed` class we might use for exploration purposes. We can use this when we want to see the boundaries of sections as we are exploring various options.
