#position

For the following experiments, work in the `07-position` folder.

In order to make more complex layouts, we need to discuss the position property. It has a bunch of possible values, and their names make no sense and are impossible to remember. Let's go through them one by one, but maybe you should bookmark this page too.

##static

static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.

To prove it, introduce this element:

~~~
  <div class="static dashed">
    <p>
      Vel et enim consulatu. Te civibus copiosae salutandi vel. Adhuc sonet libris ad eam, 
      mundi affert mea ex. Dicunt feugiat patrioque et mel, id qui nusquam maluisset, ei vim 
      justo ceteros vituperata. Mei saepe mediocrem ut. Repudiare definitiones ea ius, sint 
      commodo est ea, nam no nemore diceret.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br>
~~~

... and this rules:

~~~
.static {
  position: static;
}
~~~

Removing the `poistion:static;` entry should make no difference (try it).

##relative

relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.

Bring in this element:

~~~
  <div class="relative1 dashed">
    <p>
      Te iriure moderatius vis, nam prodesset honestatis te. Atqui facilisi at est. Ex duo vocent 
      incorrupte eloquentiam. Agam deterruisset vel at, has no illum ipsum alterum. Virtute vivendo 
      officiis his et, ius viris tollit homero ad. In sit euismod salutatus, cu eos malorum 
      luptatum consulatu, et nec debet antiopam. 
    </p>
  </div>
~~~

... and this CSS:

~~~
.relative1 {
  position: relative;
}
~~~

Because we have specified `relative` without any extra parameters, there is no real effect to observe.

Now try this:

~~~
  <div class="relative2 dashed">
    <p>
      Saperet maiestatis instructior te per, cu vel tota cotidieque. Vix illum regione deterruisset 
      cu, ne cum diam suavitate complectitur, nec ex erant principes. Augue omittam no sea, putant 
      forensibus usu te. Te iusto dicam verear mei. Dolorum posidonium no vel.    
    </p>
  </div>
~~~

... with this additional rule:

~~~
.relative2 {
  position: relative;
  top: -20px;
  left: 20px;
  width: 500px;
}
~~~

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element

##fixed

A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.

Try this:

~~~
  <div class="fixed dashed">
    <p>
      Hello! How did I get here?
    </p>
  </div>
~~~

... with this:

~~~
.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 200px;
}
~~~

This should fix an element to the lower right of the canvas. Change the window dimensions and observe what happens to that element.

#absolute

absolute is the trickiest position value. absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. If an absolutely-positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and still moves along with page scrolling. Remember, a "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.

Here is a simple example:

~~~
.relative {
  position: relative;
  width: 600px;
  height: 400px;
}
.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 120px;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}
~~~

This stuff is tricky, but it's essential to creating great CSS layouts. On the next page we'll use position in a more practical example.
