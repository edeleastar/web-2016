#float layout example

It is common to do entire layouts using float. Here is the same layout we did last week using position, but this time we use float.

Open the 12.float-layout-example folder.

In the index.html file you have a `<nav`> element and two `<section`> elements.

In the css we will float the `<nav`> elment to the left and set the margin on the `<section`> elements to be the width of the `<nav`> element.,

~~~
nav {
  float: left;
  width: 200px;
  border: solid 1px;  
}

section {
  margin-left: 200px;
  border: solid 1px;
}

.clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
}
~~~

We include the .clearfix here just to ensure that if the nav ever increased to be longer than the sections, or if the sections shrunk to be smaller than the nav that it would not overflow its container (because it is floated left).
