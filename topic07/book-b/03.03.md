#percent width

For the following experiments use the files in 13.percent-width folder

Percent is a measurement unit relative to the containing block. It's great for images: here we can make the image that it is always 50% the width of its container. 

Edit the style.css file and add the following:

~~~
article img {
  float: right;
  width: 50%;
}
~~~

By including this rule we float the image to the right of the other content.
Open the index.html page and view the result.
Fix the overflow of the image using clearfix.

Refresh the index.html page in the percent-width folder and try shrinking the viewport down to see what happens. The image should always show as 50% of the container size.

You could always use max-width to limit how big the image can grow to. It is worth experiementing with min-width aswell.

You can use percent for layout (instead of position), but this can require more work. 

Add the following to the css file:

~~~
nav {
  float: left;
   width: 25%;
   border: solid 1px;
}

section {
  margin-left: 25%;
  border: solid 1px;
}
~~~

In this example, the nav content starts to degrade in how it looks when the window is too narrow. It comes down to what works for your content.
