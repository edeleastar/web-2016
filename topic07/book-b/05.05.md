#inline-block

For the following experiments use the files in 15.inline-block folder

You can create a grid of boxes that fills the browser and wraps nicely. This has been possible for a long time using float. But now with inline-block it's even easier. inline-block elements are like inline elements but they can have a width and height.


This is the hard way of doing it (using float). 
Add the following rules to your css file:

~~~
.box {
  float: left;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 1em;
  border: solid 1px;
}

.after-box {
  clear: left;
  border: solid 1px;
}
~~~

Save and refresh the page. You should now see boxes filling 80% of the width of the body. Each box is floated left with a specific height and width with a border and margin. 

The last box must clear the others.

This is the easier way of doing it using inline-block.
Replace the previous rules with the following rules:

~~~
.box {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 1em;
  border: solid 1px;  
}

.after-box {
  border: solid 1px;
}
~~~

Save and refresh the page. Some older browsers do give trouble in their support of inline-block.
