#inline-block layout

For the following experiments use the files in 16.inline-block-layout folder

You can use inline-block for layouts (as opposed to position or float).

There are things to keep in mind:

- inline-block elements are affected by vertical-align property, which you probably want to set to top.
- You need to set the width of each column
- There will be a gap between the columns if there is any whitespace between them in the HTML

Open the css file and add the following rule:

~~~
nav{
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: top;
  width: 25%;
}
.column{
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: top;
  width: 74%;
}
~~~

This will display the navigation to the left taking up 25% of the body, and the column will display to the right taking up 74% of the body. (The other 1% is taken up in default padding for inline-blocks)
