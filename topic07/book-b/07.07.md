#column


For the following experiments use the files in 17.column folder

There is a new set of CSS properties that let you easily make multi-column text.
View the index.html page in the browser to see its current format.

Add the following rule to the css file:

~~~
.three-column {
  padding: 1em;
  -moz-column-count: 3;
  -moz-column-gap: 1em;
  -webkit-column-count: 3;
  -webkit-column-gap: 1em;
  column-count: 3;
  column-gap: 1em;
}
~~~

Add the code in the html file to ensure that the `<p`> element is a member of the three-column class.

Save all files and refresh the page.

CSS columns are very new, so you need to use the prefixes, and it won't work through IE9 or in Opera Minin. There are some more column-related properties:
