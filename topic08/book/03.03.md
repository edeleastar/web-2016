#Serving - IT Labs

To date you have been opening the web pages you have designed by locating them on your PC and opening the browser directly. This is adequate for simple pages, but does not accurately reproduce how the page/site will be browsed when it is deployed on the public Internet.

To reproduce this experience, we will need to install a `web server` on our workstations, start this server and have it make our site available in a simulated network. Some server tools can also help simplify the work flow of deploying our site to a public server so that it is accessible globally. We will attempt both in this lab.

How we proceed depends on which platform you are using. There are three options:

- (1) the PCs in the IT Labs
- (2) your own workstation - running windows
- (3) your own workstation - running macOS

Options (2) and (3) are on the next step, the remaining step here is if you are using the workstations in the Walton.

## Workstation in Walton.

Onto your root of your C:\ drive, download this archive here 

- [node.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2068306/node.zip)

Unzip the archive to the root of C: drive. This may take a few minutes. The archive is not large, but contains many small files...

Make double sure the folder is in the root of C: drive - open a Command Prompt (see last step) and set C: to be your default drive, and list all directories:

~~~
C:\Users\yourid> C:
C:\> dir
...
Directory of G:\
...
...
11/02/2015   10:00 AM <DIR>    node  
...
C:\>
~~~

Now type the following (first line only):

~~~
C:\> \node\harp init demo
Downloading boilerplate: https://github.com/harp-boilerplates/default
Initialized project at C:\demo
~~~

Then enter (first line only again):

~~~
C:\> cd demo
C:\demo> \node\harp server
------------
Harp v0.19.0 – Chloi Inc. 2012–2015
Your server is listening at http://localhost:9000/
Press Ctl+C to stop the server

~~~


Now browse to this url here:

- <http://localhost:9000>

and you should see this page:
