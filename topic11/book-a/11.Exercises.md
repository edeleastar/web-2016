#Solution

This is an archive of the completed project:

##Exercise: current

If you wish to track 'current' you can do it by replicating the navigation sections in each page (with a different item marked current). This defeats the purpose of a DRY site - (i.e. the WET option).

As this is a common problem - harp.js provides some support for a solution:

- <http://harpjs.com/docs/development/current>
- <http://harpjs.com/recipes/templating-dynamic-selected-menu-item>

See if you can figure out how to support this in your project.
